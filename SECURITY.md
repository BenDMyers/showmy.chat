# Security Policy

Thanks to server-side rendering, showmy.chat is mostly unaffected by most clientside security issues. That said, there are a couple of vectors we're especially mindful of:

1. The use of clientside scripts, namely ComfyJS and Faker.js
2. Vulnerabilities in build tooling that could impact developer workstations
