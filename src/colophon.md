# Colophon

**showmy.chat** was built as an experiment with the [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) static site generator's new on-demand [Eleventy Serverless](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/serverless/) build mode. To learn more about Eleventy Serverless, [see my stream with Eleventy creator Zach Leatherman](https://someantics.dev/first-look-eleventy-serverless/).

**showmy.chat** is hosted gratefully on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

**showmy.chat** could not be possible without the hard work put into [ComfyJS](https://github.com/instafluff/ComfyJS/), a wrapper around [tmi.js](https://tmijs.com/) that makes Twitch chats' web sockets easy to use.

The styles are currently powered by Lucas Larroche's [Pico](https://picocss.com/) styles.
